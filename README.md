Welcome to Reptor!

<p>
Reptor is a PHP application which demonstrates functionality of a modern data repository. It was developed along the recommendations of the Research Data Alliance (RDA). Currently it offers:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Untyped metadata handling by supporting several types of serialised metadata (plain text, key-value pairs, XML formats)</li>
<li>PID handling, independent of the used PID system (DOI, Handle, URN etc.)</li>
<li>Access to the object data (bitstreams) stored on the filesystem and taking care of permission management</li>
<li>Integration of Data Type Registries (DTR)</li>
<li>OAI-PMH</li>
<li>ResourceSync (partially)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
All data is stored in an arbitrary filesystem or a part of it. Only a PHP enabled webserver with access to this filesysytem is necessary to run Reptor.
